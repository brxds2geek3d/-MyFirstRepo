Brief Introduction About Myself
Hello. My name is Bradley Omondi. I'm a young man living in Nairobi, Kenya.
Currently pursuing electrical engineering in the University of Nairobi. I enjoy playing and watching football, cooking and fixing broken stuff.
I live with both my parents in an apartment. I have actually got to learn how to cook during the covid-19 period.
